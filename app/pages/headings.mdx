# Headings

All heading levels from 1 through to 6 are styled.


## Linking to headings

Some headings are given clickable links which link to the heading itself.
This is useful for sharing specific sections of a page.

As h1 headings are usually only ever found at the top of a page they don't benefit from having their own link.

Similarly having a link for h4 and beyond is also not all too useful as this increases visual clutter and the likelihood of needing to link to a specific h4, h5, or h6 is very low anyway (there probably is a better h3 to click somewhere close).


## Customization

You can of course override this behaviour on a per-heading basis.
To do so add the <InlineCode color="blue">`hasLink: true`</InlineCode> property to the heading.

Use <InlineCode color="blue">`omitSidebarLink: true`</InlineCode> to exclude a heading from the sidebar navigation.

The assigned id of the heading can also be customized using <InlineCode color="blue">`id: '<your id>'`</InlineCode>, by default the id is derived from the heading text by slugifying it.
